Scream - Virtual network sound card for Microsoft Windows
--------------------------

Scream is a virtual device driver for Windows that provides a
discrete sound device. Audio played through this device is
published on your local network as a PCM multicast stream.

Receivers on the network can pick up the stream and play it
through their own audio outputs. A simple server for Linux
(interfacing with PulseAudio) is provided.
